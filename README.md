Tespeedo
========

Tespeedo is the source code of a website which I created 2 years back using go language's app engine frontend. Go has changed but I encourage anyone looking to start a website to have a look at it to get an idea of the design of a website. 

The things taken care are

* inmemory caching of the templates for faster page load times of static websites.
* pages.go which contains the handler functions for the in main.go. 

* There were scripts used for getting content for the websites which is also included mostly written in python.
